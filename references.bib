We use the radar track data to estimate traffic separations before and after {NextGen} {OI} implementation at Memphis International Airport ({MEM}). The {FAA} implemented Phase 1of wake re-categorization ({RECAT}) separation standards at {MEM} in November 2012. We examine the counts of wake, proximity, and anomalous trajectory events for two 30-day samples of pre- and post-{RECAT} periods. While the paper focuses on the methodology and is not intended to provide a detailed safety evaluation of {RECAT}, the findings suggest that {RECAT} implementation did not adversely affect the air traffic safety.},

Only gate departure delay was significant within and across both samples. {NextGen} capabilities including wake recat appeared to minimize the random effects of instrument approach conditions ({IAC}) on operations in both samples.

	abstract = {This paper describes a stochastic analytical model for predicting airport capacity with a look-ahead horizon suitable for strategic traffic flow management. The model extends previous research on airport capacity estimation by explicitly integrating the impact of terminal weather and its uncertainty. Different types of weather forecast inputs are explored, including deterministic forecasts, deterministic forecasts with forecast error models, and ensemble forecasts, to produce distributions of predicted arrival and departure capacity for each runway configuration at an airport. The paper introduces a mathematical capacity prediction model and weather data sources supported by a proof-of-concept prototype implementation, including results of validation studies at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. These results are compared with standard airport benchmark capacities and actual observed throughputs. Results show that our analytical airport capacity model accurately predicts maximum available airport capacity for Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport for different weather conditions. The validation studies reveal a limited impact of forecast uncertainty representation on the accuracy of airport capacity predictions.},

	abstract = {In recent years Air Traffic Flow Management ({ATFM}) has become pertinent even in regions without sustained overload conditions caused by dense traffic operations. Increasing traffic volumes in the face of constrained resources has created peak congestion at specific locations and times in many areas of the world. Increased environmental awareness and economic drivers have combined to create a resurgent interest in {ATFM} as evidenced by a spate of recent {ATFM} conferences and workshops mediated by official bodies such as {ICAO}, {IATA}, {CANSO} the {FAA} and Eurocontrol. Significant {ATFM} acquisitions in the last 5 years include South Africa, Australia and India. Singapore, Thailand and Korea are all expected to procure {ATFM} systems within a year while China is expected to develop a bespoke system. Asia-Pacific nations are particularly pro-active given the traffic growth projections for the region (by 2050 half of all air traffic will be to, from or within the Asia-Pacific region). National authorities now have access to recently published international standards to guide the development of national and regional operational concepts for {ATFM}, geared to Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics ({CNS}+A) evolutions. This paper critically reviews the field to determine which {ATFM} research and development efforts hold the best promise for practical technological implementations, offering clear benefits both in terms of enhanced safety and efficiency in times of growing air traffic. An evolutionary approach is adopted starting from an ontology of current {ATFM} techniques and proceeding to identify the technological and regulatory evolutions required in the future {CNS}+A context, as the aviation industry moves forward with a clearer understanding of emerging operational needs, the geo-political realities of regional collaboration and the impending needs of global harmonisation.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this publication is to provide a high-level summary of the current state of progress towards achieving the necessary level of harmonisation and global interoperability between {NextGen} and {SESAR}. More broadly, the publication reflects the current and planned collaboration efforts by the United States and the European Union to harmonise and secure the modernisation of air traffic management not just transatlantically but globally in support of the International Civil Aviation Organisation ({ICAO}) Global Air Navigation Plan ({GANP}) and its Aviation System Block Upgrade ({ASBU}) programme. Both {NextGen} and {SESAR} recognise the need to integrate the air and ground parts of their respective {ATM} systems by addressing efficiency needs of flight trajectories planning and execution and the seamless and timely sharing of accurate information. The {US}\{u2013\}{EU} harmonisation work aims to ensure that modernisation and advances in aviation and in the air navigation systems worldwide can be made in a way that supports a high-performing aviation system over time and global cooperation leading to seamless operations and safe and efficient practices for the airspace users and the travelling public. {NextGen} and {SESAR} have together made significant progress in several critical areas since the publication of the first edition of the State of Harmonisation in 2014. This second edition therefore provides an update on each of these areas and captures a number of evolutions that have or will have an impact on the collaborative activities.},

	abstract = {There are many runway capacity estimation models currently available today, and developers usually claim that their models have been validated. However, information about the validation process is often limited, and different models are validated at different levels of complexity. As a result, this paper proposes two validation methodologies that can be used to test model predictions against reality. We demonstrate the methods on two models--the Airfield Capacity Model ({ACM}) and Runway Simulator ({rS})--and two airports—{SFO} and {LAX}. The results indicate that both models tend to over-predict capacities under good visibility conditions, and predict wider ranges of capacities than are seen empirically. Overall, capacity estimates from {rS} are typically more accurate than those from {ACM}.},

	abstract = {This work contributes to the development of microscopic traffic performance models in the airport. It enhances the existing models and develops new ones. An important contribution of this research is the empirical work, i.e. estimating models using statistically rigorous methods and microscopic data collected from real traffic. With the ever increasing congestion at airports around the world, studies into ways of maximizing infrastructures capacity and minimizing delay costs while meeting the goals of the airlines are necessary. The methodology applied for the calculation of runway capacity start from the traffic data elaboration of the Naples International Airport: we have been determined this aim from the airline pattern in the above airport. The hourly capacity is calculated as the inverse of the headway of consecutive aircraft operation; this is drawn with an average of the time headway in the “critical periods”. The determination of the “capacity periods" it happens in three phases: in the first one we are drawn by the sample the stationary periods; in the second we are considered, of these, only those with the lowest averages time headway, these are called "critical" periods; subsequently we are examined only that (critical periods) had time length less than the 60 minutes and that have an average of time headway that it is almost attested around to a constant value. The stationary periods, as it says the same definition, are characterized by the relatives constant time headway, in other words there aren’t meaningful phenomenon of increase or diminution of the traffic flow. The critical periods are static periods that are found on the traffic flow curve defined "critic", this curve we have obtained to envelop some values that mark the lower limit of the diagram defined time length vs. averages of the static periods. Defined the critical periods we have been determined the experimental headway curves and we compared with those theoretical. Of such experimental curves we have been considered the characteristics values: the average and the standard deviation. In this way we have determined a matrix of the average time headway both for operations flight that for type of airplane. The following step has been that to define and to implement the analytical model. We suggest a mathematic algorithm that is able to optimize, a posteriori, the flight operation under the delay restraint. The algorithm determines the best sequence of aircrafts that minimizes the delays and it maximizes the runway capacity. The proposed methodology, even if determine an evident improvement of the runway capacity, in the respect of thresholds of acceptable average delays (constrain), represents an initial methodological phase that will desirably conclude in the determination of a "dynamic" model, that is able to assist the inspectors' job in way real-time, assigning, opportunely, an excellent sequence of the successions of flight operations.},

	abstract = {Today, the demand for increasing airport capacity is high, in particular for increasing runway throughput from an {ATM} perspective. Runway capacity is often directly linked with the minima longitudinal separation between aircraft on approach phase or between aircraft on departure. The separation minima are based on surveillance capabilities and on wake turbulence ({WT}) in order to mitigate respectively collision risk and {WT}-induced accidents, therefore {WT} hazard becomes a major concern for {ATM}. For ten years, many research {LIDAR} systems have been used for better understanding wake vortices behaviors in the operational environment within large range of wind and turbulence conditions. All these studies[1][2] helped to design new concepts of wake separations between aircrafts thanks to the proven capabilities of {LIDAR} systems to assess the risks of wake vortex ({WV}) encounters through the circulation retrievals. The re-categorization project, called {RECAT} [8], has been launched by a joint {EUROCONTROL} – {FAA} initiative in order to renew and optimize the out-of-date currently applied {ICAO} regulations on distance separation. Nowadays, the first phase of regional {RECAT} projects, which consists in defining new distance separation matrices composed of six/seven static aircraft categories instead of three, entered the operational phase and is deployed in several airports in United States and Europe. In addition, other concepts like Time-Based Separation have also been studied and deployed in London Heathrow. The airports where these solutions have been deployed obtained significant benefits as increased runway throughput and improved resilience to disruptions. For implementing such new {WT} solutions at an airport, a local safety assessment before the implementation and a risk monitoring after are usually needed. Before implementation, it may be required to determine for the targeted airport the relative variations of risk of wake vortex encounters, given the local {ATM} rules, the traffic mix, the weather conditions and their impact on the wake vortex decay. After implementation, the risk monitoring might perform in-depth analysis of wake vortex encounter reported by pilots. For all the mentioned steps, the use of scanning Doppler {LIDARs} is the only experimental sensor capable of measuring the localization and the circulation of the wake vortices and to provide ground truth wake vortex measurements. Next generation operational {LIDARs} need to be developed to address in a cost effective way these operational needs. Furthermore, a specific configuration and methodology need to be developed to ensure the accuracy of the wake vortex data. Such a {LIDAR} based wake vortex solution has been tested at Paris Charles De Gaulle which implemented the {RECAT}-{EU} wake separation scheme. The wake vortex circulation, initial spacing and decay measured have been compared to the data collected in London Heathrow by a different {LIDAR} sensor. The results indicated that the initial circulation, the time to demise, the decay curve evolution and the vortex spacing are very coherent between the two databases.},

	abstract = {The evolutions of aircraft wake vortices near ground in stable atmospheric boundary layer are studied by Large Eddy Simulation ({LES}). The sensitivity of vortex evolution to the Monin-Obukhov (M-O) scale is studied for the first time. The results indicate that increasing stability leads to longer lifetimes of upwind vortices, while downwind vortices will decay faster due to a stronger crosswind shear under stable conditions. Based on these results, an empirical model of the vortex lifetime asa function of 10-m-high crosswind and the M-O scale is summarized. This model can provide an estimate of the upper boundary of the vortex lifetime according to the real-time crosswind and atmospheric stability. In addition, the lateral translation of vortices is also inspected. The results show that vortices can travel a furthest distance of 722m in the currently-studied parameter range. This result is meaningful to safety analysis of airports that have parallel runways.},

%%%%%%% CHOOSE ONE OF THESE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% projectreport: Project report (CS)
%% bachelors: Bachelor of Science thesis
%% masters: Master of Science thesis
%% doctorate: Doctor of Philosophy dissertation
%
%%%%%%% CHOOSE ONE OF THESE %%%%%%
%% 
%% draft: speed up processing by skipping graphics and adding useful
%%     information for editing.  Also sets spacing to double so that it is easier to
%%     write editing marks on paper copy.
%% proof:  proofreading version (final formatting with warnings)
%% final: generate document for submission, removing FIXMEs, and
%%     other markup.  Throw error if any fatal FIXMEs still in document.
%%
%%%%%%% CHOOSE ONE OF THESE IF APPLICABLE %%%%%%
%%
%% deptsse: School of Science and Engineering
%% deptscs: School of Computer Science
%%
%%%%%%%% CHOOSE ANY COMBINATION OF THESE %%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% forcegraphics: force graphics, etc. to be included, even in draft mode
%% debug:  writes more messages to the log file, adds debugging output 
%%     and sizing boxes
%% icelandic: thesis is in Icelandic
%% oldstyle:  use the PhD headers and footers from the old CS template
%% online: for online versions (skip blank pages)
\documentclass[table,xcdraw,online,masters,deptsse,forcegraphics,draft]{ruthesis}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TeXStudio Magic Comments %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% These comments that start with "!TeX" modify the way TeXStudio works
%% For details see http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/manual/current/usermanual_en.html   Section 4.10
%%
%% What encoding is the file in?
% !TeX encoding = UTF-8
%% What language should it be spellchecked?
% !TeX spellcheck = en_US
%% What program should I compile this document with?
% !TeX program = xelatex

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Bibliography options %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% We suggest switching from bibtex to biblatex/biber because it is better able
%% to deal with Icelandic characters and other bibliography issues
%% As long as you use biblatex instead of bibtex by itself, it will at least
%%  generate a document without errors.
%% !!!If you are using TeXStudio, don't forget to update the bibliography setting!!!
\usepackage[backend=biber,bibencoding=utf8,style=ieee]{biblatex}
%\DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}  
% need to declare mapping for style=apa to alphabetize properly
% If you set backend=bibtex, it will use bibtex for processing (old way)
%    this can work with Icelandic characters, but you may get weird results.
%    bibtex does not know how to sort Þ and ð
% if you set backend=biber, you can use UTF8 characters such as Þ and
%     ð  but you will have to remember to switch from using bibtex to 
%     biber in your client
% If you use JabRef, make sure the file is encoded in UTF-8 which is
%    not the default.

%% This tells TeXStudio to use biber
% !TeX TXS-program:bibliography = txs:///biber
%% This also sets the bibliography program for TeXShop and TeXWorks
% !BIB program = biber

% Where is your reference library?
\addbibresource{references.bib}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CUSTOMIZATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% It is not recommended that you customize this file nor
%% ruthesis.cls.  Just fill in the necessary fields.  You should put
%% your macros and packages into a separate file so that it is easier
%% to use updates to the template.  The custom.sty file was created
%% for this reason.  We load this much later so that it can overrite
%% any existing settings
\IfFileExists{custom.sty}{\usepackage{custom}}{}

%%%% My user packages-Toma%%%%%%
\usepackage{multirow}

%\usepackage[table,xcdraw]{xcolor} %% this was added to the \documentclass[..here..]

The work on this thesis was supported by 2018~Isavia grant.
Additionally the Isavia company provided a workplace and the means to obtain the necessary information from the company servers. Special appreciation goes to Hjalti Pálsson, Head of Research and Development Department and his team of professionals: Atli Norðmann Sigurðarson, Specialist, for valuable insight into the manner of retrieving and analysing the data, Víkingur Logi Ásgeirsson, Project Manager, for his beneficial assistance in managing the specifics of the Python code.

I would like to give thanks to my supervisors Þorgeir Pálsson and Ármann Gylfason for the support and valuable advice throughout the process of developing this study.

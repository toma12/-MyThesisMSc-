    \caption[Runway usage at BIKF]{Overall runway usage at BIKF for a period of one year since October 2017. Almost half of all arrivals during that period (44,7\%) use RWY-19, followed by RWY-01 (25,7\%) and RWY-10 (17.6\%). The summer traffic favours RWY-19 with 52.8\%~(Figure~\ref{fig:runway_usage_summer}), while during the winter season some of those arrivals are diverted towards RWY-01 and RWY-10~(Figure~\ref{fig:runway_usage_summer}). RWY-28 is least used despite its fast-exit TWY B-1.}

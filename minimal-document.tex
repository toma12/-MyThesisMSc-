%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TeXStudio Magic Comments %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% These comments that start with "!TeX" modify the way TeXStudio works
%% For details see http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/manual/current/usermanual_en.html   Section 4.10
%%
%% What encoding is the file in?
% !TeX encoding = UTF-8
%% What language should it be spellchecked?
% !TeX spellcheck = en_US
%% What program should I compile this document with?
% !TeX program = xelatex

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Bibliography options %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% We suggest switching from bibtex to biblatex/biber because it is better able
%% to deal with Icelandic characters and other bibliography issues
%% As long as you use biblatex instead of bibtex by itself, it will at least
%%  generate a document without errors.
%% !!!If you are using TeXStudio, don't forget to update the bibliography setting!!!
\usepackage[backend=biber,bibencoding=utf8,style=ieee]{biblatex}
%\DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}  
% need to declare mapping for style=apa to alphabetize properly
% If you set backend=bibtex, it will use bibtex for processing (old way)
%    this can work with Icelandic characters, but you may get weird results.
%    bibtex does not know how to sort Þ and ð
% if you set backend=biber, you can use UTF8 characters such as Þ and
%     ð  but you will have to remember to switch from using bibtex to 
%     biber in your client
% If you use JabRef, make sure the file is encoded in UTF-8 which is
% not the default.

%% This tells TeXStudio to use biber
% !TeX TXS-program:bibliography = txs:///biber
%% This also sets the bibliography program for TeXShop and TeXWorks
% !BIB program = biber

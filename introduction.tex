Keflavik International Airport is the major airport in Iceland with three runways\fxnote{how many runways?}. There has been a gradual increase of passengers travelling through Keflavik in the recent years with over eight million passengers and 62,3 thousand air transport movements in 2017\cite{isavia_facts_2017}. For 2018 the passenger numbers show a growth of 13.1\% on average from the previous year\cite{isavia_pass_statistics_2018}. The increase in traffic at Keflavik Airport can encounter constrained capacity of the runway during peak traffic periods. 
A significant constraint of this process is caused by separation regulations of aircraft due to wake-vortices. These are specified by rules established by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)  for each type of aircraft based primarily on the weight of the aircraft. The general flight safety requirements are established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for maintaining safe distance between aircraft

Aircraft in flight generate a wake in the flow that has two characteristic vortices extending behind the craft originating at the wingtips. The kinetic energy contained in the vortices creates turbulence which is dependent on the weight and aerodynamic properties of the generating aircraft. This can lead to the up-set and potentially loss of control of a smaller aircraft following the flightpath of a preceding airplane. To diminish the effect of such vortices the trailing aircraft must be maintained at a safe distance behind the lead aircraft as the vortices  laterally spread to either side of the flightpath and are dissipated.
